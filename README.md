# Speed-Typing-Test-Using-Python
The speed typing test is a project through which you can test your typing speed.
It’s a very useful game to track your typing speed and improve it with regular practice.
For a graphical user interface, we are going to use the pygame library which is used for working with graphics. 
we need to import the pygame library along with some built-in modules of Python like time and random library.

# Prerequisites
Pip install pygame - To install the pygame library in your terminal.
Download certain images to make our GUI more presentable
Background.jpg – A background image we will use in our program
Icon.png – An icon image that we will use as a reset button.
Sentences.txt – This text file will contain a list of sentences separated by a new line.
Speed typing.py – The main program file that contains all the code
Typing-speed-open.png – The image to display when starting game
